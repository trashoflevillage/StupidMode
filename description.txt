Stupid Mode will make your game difficult in the most stupid way possible.

As of current, Stupid Mode adds various changes, both in boss fights and outside of them. Rather than listing these changes, I'll just list the affected boss fights.

- King Slime
- Eye of Cthulhu
- Eater of Worlds
- Brain of Cthulhu
- Deerclops
- Queen Bee
- Skeletron
- Wall of Flesh

~ Moon Lord (I added something to the fight, although the mod does not cover all content up to this point.)

This mod is NOT compatible with multiplayer as of yet.
